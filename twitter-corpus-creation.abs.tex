The ubiquity of social media posts containing broad public opinion
offers an alternative data source to complement some shortcomings of traditional surveys.
While surveys collect representative samples and achieve relatively high accuracy,
they are both expensive to run and lag public opinion by days or weeks,
which could be overcome with a real-time data stream and fast analysis pipeline.
One challenge in this pipeline we seek to address is selecting the best corpus of relevant documents for analysis. 
Querying with keywords alone often includes irrelevant documents
that are not easily disambiguated with bag-of-words NLP methods. 
We explore methods of corpus curation to filter irrelevant tweets using pre-trained transformer-based models,
fine-tuned for our binary classification task on hand-labeled tweets,
and achieving F1 scores of up to 0.95.
The low cost and high performance of fine-tuning such a model suggests
it should be widely adopted as a pre-processing step for social media datasets with uncertain corpus boundaries.
